RunMD is a command-line tool designed to extract and execute code blocks from Markdown files. It's particularly useful for managing and running code snippets embedded in documentation or notes.

> **⚠** RunMD is intended for use with scripting languages only (e.g., Shell, Python, Ruby, JavaScript). It does not support compiled languages (e.g., C, C++, Java) as it cannot handle compilation and execution steps.
>
> **⚠** RunMD is different from interactive notebooks like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or [Zepplin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/). Each code block is independent and executed separately.
